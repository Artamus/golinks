Potential improvements:
- Permit a list of owners instead of just 1. (In the current implementation this is a bit pointless I think.)
- Implement search functionality for long links. (Would have to figure out how to cut links for searching, full string search would not work if there are query params in the URL, whereas too short would just match every Google Doc.)
